=== Deluge 1.3.0 (In Development) ===
	* Improved Logging
	* Removed the AutoAdd feature on the core. It's now handled with the AutoAdd
	plugin, which is also shipped with Deluge, and it does a better job and
	now, it even supports multiple users perfectly.
	* Authentication/Permission exceptions are now sent to clients and recreated
	there to allow acting upon them.
	* Enforced the use of the "deluge.plugins" namespace to reduce package
	names clashing beetween regular packages and deluge plugins.

==== Core ====
	* Implement #1063 option to delete torrent file copy on torrent removal - patch from Ghent
	* Implement #457 progress bars for folders
	* Implement #1012 httpdownloader supports gzip decoding
	* #496: Remove deprecated functions in favour of get_session_status()
	* #1112: Fix renaming files in add torrent dialog
	* #1247: Fix deluge-gtk from hanging on shutdown
	* #995: Rewrote tracker_icons
	* Make the distinction between adding to the session new unmanaged torrents
	and torrents loaded from state. This will break backwards compatability.
	* Pass a copy of an event instead of passing the event arguments to the
	event handlers. This will break backwards compatability.
	* Allow changing ownership of torrents.
	* File modifications on the auth file are now detected and when they happen,
	the file is reloaded. Upon finding an old auth file with an old format, an
	upgrade to the new format is made, file saved, and reloaded.
	* Authentication no longer requires a username/password. If one or both of
	these is missing, an authentication error will be sent to the client
	which sould then ask the username/password to the user.
	* Implemented sequential downloads.
	* #378: Provide information about a torrent's pieces states
